- [Become a werewolf](#become-a-werewolf)
- [Unlock new abilities](#unlock-new-abilities)

## Become a Vampire
It's possible to become a vampire by using a vampire tooth or by being bitten by one, although the chances are low in the latter case. Vampires can be found in the dark forest, where it's the easiest place to become a vampire. The vampire tooth item has a 50% chance of dropping when defeating a vampire.

The transformation takes 5 minutes, and you'll be able to track the time through the hunger effect added to the player. At the end of the time, you'll receive an item called "Vampire skills," where you can choose and use vampire abilities.

If you want to avoid becoming a vampire, within the 5 minutes, you can prevent it by heating a bucket of milk in the furnace and drinking the hot milk bucket.

## Drink Blood
Only when you're a vampire will you feel a new type of hunger, the thirst for blood. With the thirst indicator located just above the hunger indicator, you can monitor the vampire's thirst level.

The vampire's thirst cannot be satisfied with regular food; you need to drink blood to fill the blood thirst bar. You can do this in two ways: by drinking blood bottles, which can be obtained by biting a mob while holding a glass bottle, or by finding them in structures throughout the world. The second method is to drink directly from the mobs by by right-clicking or the equivalent of the use button (you must be holding any item for it to work).

If the thirst bar reaches zero, the vampire will become weaker and won't be able to use its abilities anymore, losing all its resistance abilities temporarily.

## Become a Werewolf
It's possible to become a werewolf by using a werewolf fang or by being bitten by one, although the chances are low in the latter case. Werewolves can be found in the dark forest, where it's the easiest place to become a werewolf. The werewolf fang item has a 50% chance of dropping when defeating a werewolf.

The transformation takes 5 minutes, and you'll be able to track the time through the hunger effect added to the player. At the end of the time, you'll receive an item called "Werewolf skills," where you can choose and use werewolf abilities.

If you want to avoid becoming a werewolf, within the 5 minutes, you can prevent it by heating a bucket of milk in the furnace and drinking the hot milk bucket.

## Unlock New Abilities
After becoming a vampire or werewolf, it's possible to unlock new abilities. To do this, you'll need a blood altar and use filled blood bottles or werewolf livers to fill it.

Once the altar is completely filled, you just need to use a vampire tooth or a werewolf fang on the altar, depending on whether you're a werewolf (werewolf fang) or a vampire (vampire tooth). A screen will appear showing the abilities still to be unlocked; you'll need to have the items it asks for, but in the case of the werewolf you'll need to have the level in addition to the items.
